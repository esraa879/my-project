Part 3: Node Internals

What is the Node.js Event Loop?
The Event Loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O. It continuously checks the call stack and processes asynchronous callbacks from queues when the stack is empty.

What is Libuv and What Role Does It Play in Node.js?
Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous operations such as file system access, networking, timers, and the event loop, providing cross-platform support.

How Does Node.js Handle Asynchronous Operations Under the Hood?
Node.js delegates asynchronous tasks to the system (OS) or Libuv’s thread pool. Once completed, their callbacks are placed in the appropriate queue to be executed by the event loop.

What is the Difference Between the Call Stack, Event Queue, and Event Loop in Node.js?

Call Stack: Executes synchronous code.

Event Queue: Holds callbacks of completed async operations.

Event Loop: Moves callbacks from the queue to the call stack when it is empty.

What is the Node.js Thread Pool and How to Set the Thread Pool Size?
The thread pool is part of Libuv and is used for operations like file I/O and cryptography. Its size can be set using the environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE.

How Does Node.js Handle Blocking and Non-Blocking Code Execution?
Blocking code runs synchronously and stops the event loop, delaying other tasks. Non-blocking code runs asynchronously, allowing Node.js to continue processing other operations without waiting.
